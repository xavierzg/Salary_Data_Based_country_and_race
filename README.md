# Salary databased country and race
## Introduction
In this project, we clean a dataset containing various type of variables to predict salary implementing several machine learing algorithms.
## Goals
Clean the dataset to achieve the best performance. <br>
Implement machine learning algorithms. <br>
Observe and determine which algorithm performs best.
## This project's repo includes the following files:
The procces to clean the dataset (1_Data_analysis.ipynb) <br>
Implementation of multiple algorithms (2_Linear_regression.ipynb, 3_Logistic_regression.ipynb, 4_K_neighbors.ipynb, 5_Decision_Trees, 6_Neuronal_networks) <br>
The original data (Salary_Data_Based_Country_and_race.csv) <br>
The clean data (clean_data.csv)
## This project includes the following steps:
1. Null values checkout. <br>
2. Clasification of nominal and ordinal variables. <br>
3. Data visualization and data statistics. <br>
4. Feature selection. <br>
5. Implementation of algorithms and selecting hyperparameters.
